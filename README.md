<sub>*Data Scientist | Data Analyst | Statistician*</sub>

I've been passionate about Data Science and Python since 2020 and I'm currently studying Data Science at the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul. Currently, I acquire experience as a Data Scientist in solving real problems in order to improve and practice my knowledge.

In this portfolio, I try to model 3 frequent problems in the area of data science (regression, classification and clustering problems), going through all the steps of developing a business solution using concepts and techniques of business understanding, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, machine learning modeling, and publishing models using clouds.
